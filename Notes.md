# Building the SmartAC project in Go
I've just completed a small trial project in C# as a POC for a potential client.  The project idea is kind of interesting so I decided to use it as a way to explore my interest in Golang.  There is a project spec in the docs folder so you can get the full details there, but briefly the project is an API and management tool for smart air conditioners which send sensor data about their environment every minute.  The API is really simple and includes the following:
- Register new device
- Get device
- Get all devices
- Search devices based on serialNr
- Submit sensor data (temp, humidity, CO level, health status, etc)

There is also a simple website management interface so admins can login and look at device data graphs and any alerts generated by the system.

The API was dead simple to do in C# and I guess it'll be pretty easy in Golang too.  The point in this exercie for me is more to explore the cannonical project structures and best practices with Golang.  I'm also not very adept at building even simple user interfaces so I think this will be useful for me to go through the basics there.  

## Feedback and comments
I'm putting all this out in the open as a way to give back and share.  I really enjoy golang and there are thousands of tutorials and open source projects which may or may not be better quality than this humble document. Nevertheless, if you're still reading this account of my journey through Go, you probably have good reason.  As such, I genuinley welcome any and all feedback and questions.  I've been working with MS technologies for 20+ years, so I know a little bit about a little bit. But mostly what I know is that there is always some new perspective and possible improvements.  I'm also a total n00b with golang so don't take any of this too seriously.  


## Project structure
I generally spend a lot of time thinking about project structures.  In my experience, the way your project is laid out can have a significant impact on the long term extensibility and useability of the project.  I'm a stickler for organisation in code projects and believe that everything confers semantic value.  File and folder names are only the beginning, but they are an important place to start.  With a .net project I know enough to have an informed opinion about smart ways to structure things.  I guess I know enough to feel confident defending controversial positions (look at the C# version of this prototype) and also adapt easily to new ways of doing things.  With golang... well, not so much.  I'm still kind of in the phase of typing stuff in verbatim from tutorials, or maybe just beyond that. 

That said, concepts like testability, separation of concerns, SOLID principles and semantic clarity are univeral concepts which go beyond the syntactical and task oriented focus of most tutorials.  Figuring out some of that additional stuff is what this project is about.  With golang and google, you can really get a sample project up and running (and possibly even deployed to GCP) in just a few hours, even if you're new.  But I want the project to make sense so we have to go deeper.
